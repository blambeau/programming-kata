## The Klaro Cards's month columns kata

## Problem description

In Klaro Cards, when you have a series of cards with a date, you can view them in columns. In the example, blog posts can be viewed by month, quarter, or year. You can also choose whether or not to display empty columns.

You are responsible for writing the logic behind this feature. Given a set of cards with a publication date, calculate the columns to display. Once your program is written, add the option that allows showing or hiding empty columns.

To keep the exercise simple, we focus only on the function that calculates which columns to display, and only with a monthly periodicity. You don’t even have to calculate the groups of cards for each column (but you can if you want).

Use whichever language or method you prefer (BDD, TDD, Example Mapping, Pair Programming, etc.). We are especially interested in what you call the “Specification” once the job is done.
